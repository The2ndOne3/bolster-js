Bolster.js
==========
Bolster is a JavaScript plugin built on MooTools that extends CSS to create effects that can't be generated with static CSS. It works on a superset of CSS, providing additional keywords to create dynamic effects that can only be generated at runtime using JavaScript.

Usage
=====
Bolster scans all linked CSS files for its keywords. All you need to do is link an external CSS file and Bolster will take care of the rest.
